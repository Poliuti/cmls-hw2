\section{Introduction}

The aim of this document is to describe the realization of a flanger effect plugin with feedback. For the implementation we relied on JUCE, a partially open-source cross-platform C ++ application framework.
In particular the section ~\ref{sec:flanger} contains the description in detail of the alghoritm of our digital flanger effect, starting from a simple delay line.The section ~\ref{sec:gui}refers instead to the graphic interface and to the management of user controls. We added some additional controls, in particular the possibility to choice the type of wave of the LFO and an high pass filter on the wet signal. These are illustrated in the section (?)

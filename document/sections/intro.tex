\section{Introduction}

The aim of this document is to describe the realization of a flanger effect plugin with feedback. For the implementation we relied on JUCE, a partially open-source cross-platform \texttt{C++} application framework.

In particular the section ~\ref{sec:flanger} contains a detailed description of the alghoritm of our digital flanger, starting from a simple delay line and becoming a stereo flanger with identical settings except the phase of the low-frequency oscillator.

The section ~\ref{sec:gui} refers instead to the graphic interface and to the management of user controls. We added some additional controls, in particular the possibility to choose the type of wave of the LFO and an high pass filter on the wet signal.

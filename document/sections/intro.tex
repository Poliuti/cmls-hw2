\section{Introduction}

The aim of this document is to describe the realization of a flanger effect plug-in with feedback. For the implementation we relied on JUCE~\cite{juce}, a partially open-source cross-platform \texttt{C++} application framework.

Section~\ref{sec:flanger} contains a detailed description of the algorithm of our digital flanger, starting from a simple delay line to a stereo flanger with identical settings except the phase of the low-frequency oscillator.
Section~\ref{sec:interpolation} contains a detailed discussion on different interpolation techniques, used to handle fractional delay times in a discrete domain.
Section~\ref{sec:gui} refers instead to the graphic user interface and to the management of user controls.
